    This template is a dust template, and the non-HTML markup located in
    here is defined by the linkedin fork of dust. This is a dust comment

       Moustache like syntax is used by dust.
       A section reference to an element changes the context
       to the value mapped to this property.
       As songs is an array, this block will also run for each
       element in the array.
