# Lab: File API

Assuming you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed:

    npm install
    node server

* Lab work should be confined to code.js (shouldn't need to modify other files).
* Implement the ability for users to drag and drop files into the browser onto the #drop-zone.
* List meta information about the file: name, size, and type, if they are available, within the file-info tag.
* Read out the contents (using a FileReader) of a text file into the file-contents HTML element.
* Use the included "text.txt" to test things out.
